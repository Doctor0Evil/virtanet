# SwarmNet

SwarmNet is an advanced orchestration and automation framework for multi-agent and robotic swarm systems, engineered with compliance, auditability, and unstoppable workflow resilience at its core. Its unique design philosophy guarantees reliable group behavior, decentralized error recovery, and complete integration with enterprise security paradigms.[11][5]

## Key Features

- **Workflow Orchestration:** Enable continuous, staged, or event-driven swarming operations across distributed agents and environments.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Leverages decentralized, agent-side error detection, diagnosis, and recovery for true swarm-grade robustness.[11]
- **Compliance & Audit:** All operations are logged with immutable traceability, and the platform enforces strict separation of privileges and sandboxing of all task cycles.
- **Dynamic Repair:** Public and private workflows can self-heal, escalate to manual review, or auto-revalidate graphs—even during critical infrastructure migrations.
- **Protected Layering:** Every critical pipe and payload operation is executed inside named, access-scoped sandboxes using swarmnet overlays for advanced isolation.

## Usage Overview

SwarmNet enables the safe deployment and management of semantic, audit-ready swarms for distributed credentials, multi-cloud cutovers, and multi-agent intelligence.[5][11]

- **Instantiate and Join:** Launch agents which broadcast their join/computation intent. Automatic propagation ensures all actors are registered and monitored.
- **Message Handlers:** Register distributed computation or audit functions keyed by a simple command interface.
- **Concurrent Execution:** Define algorithm pools for flexible task distribution—scale up or down without sacrificing audit coverage.
- **Modular Integration:** Embed as a CI/CD orchestrator step, backend policy agent, or as semantic weaver for federated identity and access automation.

## Compliance and Security

- **Enterprise-Grade Policies:** Every operation complies with platform security mandates, legal constraints, and integrates blockchain anchoring when required.
- **Continuous Audit Log:** Each phase—init, transition, recovery, or termination—is verified, authorized, and documented in tamper-evident logs.
- **Automatic Rollback:** Built-in RAG-mode logging and auto-revert logic prevent propagation of faulty or out-of-policy states.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/swarmnet.git
   ```
2. **Configure your agents and workflows in compliance with provided workflow YAML or AML files.**
3. **Bootstrap your first swarmnet session using approved sandbox and compliance flags.**
4. **Monitor with integrated logs or custom dashboards for continuous assurance.**

## Documentation

- **Workflows & Templates:** See included `.yaml` and `.aml` for example configuration of dynamic-repair cycles, transition cutover, and semantic weaver deployments.
- **API Reference:** Robust, minimal APIs for agent join, message parsing, error correction, and audit triggering are included.
- **Security & Compliance:** Full guide to policy hooks, sandboxing, and proper delegation of privilege.

## Governance Statement

SwarmNet is engineered with never-fail correction, forensic ready design, and enforcement of ultimate compliance standards. Bypass attempts, privilege escalation, or non-audited task execution are structurally blocked. All modifications and deployment scenarios must conform to the strictest legal and enterprise controls.[11]
